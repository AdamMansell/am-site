    "I grew up in California as an Australian-American, spending my time either running or flying drones. I had a love for two things - Running, and Technology (embarisingly inspired by Tony Stark... yes, Iron Man). I quickly developed a burning desire to be at the forefront of technology, and what better way to start - than to code. ",

Whether that be parking lot capacity left, snowfall in the last 24 hours, or ski lift wait times - Snö would allow for the info to be accessed from any device, whenever desired. It's time to say goodbye to snow day problems, and hello to Snö.",
